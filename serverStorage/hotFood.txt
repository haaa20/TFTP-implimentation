Plot

Michael and his family sit down to eat potatoes, however they're all hot so Michael, Brian and Connie before eating the potato blow on a piece of it that's on their fork until it's cool and eat it.

Instead of doing what his other family members did Harold stuffs a great big chunk of potato into his mouth and due to the heat burning the inside of his mouth his eyes pop out, he flaps his hands towards his mouth in an attempt to cool his mouth, yells, bobs his head up and down and spits bits of potato all over his plate, and warns everybody that the potato's really hot.

Then into the mouth. *hawlp* *click* Noice. And there's my brother, he's doing the same. *puff-puff* Into the mouth. *hawlp* *click* Noice! There's my mum, she's doing the same. *puff puff* Into the mouth. *hawlp* *click* Nice! But my dad. My dad, what does he do? He stuffs a great big chunk of potato, and then that really does it. His eyes pop out. He flaps his hands. He blows, he puffs, he yells, he bobs his head up and down. He spits bits of potato all over his plate and he turns to us and he says, "Watch out, everybody! The potato's really hot!" (jazzy saxophone music)
